# WHAT CHANGED
### Nothing really!!!
While going through the site today I found it quite hard relating with most of the icons in the tools section.<br/>
I had to inspect the page in other to find out what most of them meant and not everyone's ready to do that so I decided to simply add the title attribute in the <i></i> elements you have in your code in the tools section.
<br/>Besides all of that, I think the website is perfect.<br/>
You're doing great brother.
